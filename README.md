This is a Simple And Funny Quiz Game By Flutter. Just True Or False Game By Pressing A Button. Show our Selected Answers to A Row Widget. I used for Pillars Of OOP In This Small Project.

# What Is Dart? [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=dart)](https://skillicons.dev)
art is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Google, designed for building web, mobile, server, and desktop applications. It features a C-style syntax and was first unveiled in 2011. Dart has gained significant popularity, particularly due to its integration with the Flutter framework, which allows developers to create high-performance, cross-platform applications from a single codebase.

# What Is Flutter? [![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=flutter)](https://skillicons.dev)
Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit (SDK) created by Google, designed for building natively compiled applications for multiple platforms from a single codebase. First introduced in 2015 and officially released in May 2017, Flutter allows developers to create applications for iOS, Android, web, desktop (Windows, macOS, Linux), and Google's Fuchsia operating system.

# What Is Quiz Game? ‚ÅâÔ∏è
Quiz Game: A quiz game is a form of entertainment that typically involves answering questions, often in a competitive format. Participants may compete individually or in teams, and the questions can cover a wide range of subjects, from trivia to specialized knowledge areas.

# What Is OOP? üîò
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data and code. Here are the key aspects of OOP:

- Definition:
  - OOP is a programming approach that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. It focuses on creating reusable, modular code by defining classes that serve as blueprints for creating objects.

# What Is Encapsulation? üíä
Encapsulation is the technique of restricting direct access to an object's data and internal workings. It involves:
- Making data members private
- Providing public methods (getters and setters) to access and modify the data
- Maintaining data integrity by controlling how data is accessed and modified
This allows for better control over the object's data and helps prevent unintended modifications1.

# What Is Inheritance? üéÖ
Inheritance enables a class to acquire properties and methods from another class. Key aspects include:
- Establishes a parent-child (or superclass-subclass) relationship between classes
- Promotes code reuse and reduces duplication
- Allows for the creation of hierarchical relationships between objects
For example, a "Car" class could inherit common properties from a "Vehicle" class.

# What Is Polymorphism? ü™ß
Polymorphism allows objects to take on multiple forms. It manifests in two main ways:
- Method Overloading (Static Polymorphism): Multiple methods with the same name but different parameters within a class
- Method Overriding (Dynamic Polymorphism): Subclasses can provide specific implementations of methods defined in their parent class
Polymorphism enables more flexible and extensible code design.

# What Is Abstraction? üí¢
Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only essential features. It includes:
- Creating abstract classes or interfaces that define a common structure
- Implementing these abstractions in concrete classes
- Focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it
For instance, a music player interface might have "play," "pause," and "stop" methods without exposing the underlying audio processing details.
